While you can see your account details by navigating to WordPress Dashboard > Radio Station > Account, logging into the Freemius Dashboard will give you full control over your account.

### Can I try Radio Station PRO before I purchase the plugin?

### How do I schedule a Show? 

Simply create a new show via Add Show in the Radio Station plugin menu in the Admin area. You will be able to assign Shift timeslots to it on the Show edit page, as well as add the Show description and other meta fields, including Show images.
In order to schedule a Show, a Show must be added and available to accept schedule entries. If this is your first time using Radio Station, create a new show via the Add Show item in the Radio Stationn menu in your WordPress Admin screen. You can assign Shift timeslots to your new Show or pre-existing Show on the Show edit page, as well as add a Show description and other meta fields, including Show images.

### How do I display a full schedule of my Station's shows? 

Navigate to the plugin Settings page via the Radio Station menu in your WordPress Admin screen and then click the Pages tab. There you can select the Page on which to automatically display the schedule, as well as which View to display (a Table grid by default.) Alternatively, you can use the shortcode `[master-schedule]` on any page (or post.) This option allows you to use additional shortcode attributes to control what is displayed in your Schedule (see [Master Schedule Shortcode Docs](./Shortcodes.md#master-schedule-shortcode) )

### Why aren't all my Shows displaying in the program schedule?

Did you remember to check the "Active" checkbox for each Show? If a Show is not marked active, the plugin assumes that it's not currently in production and it is not shown on the Schedule. A Show will also not be shown if it has a Draft status or has no active Shifts assigned to it.

### What if I want to schedule a special event or one-off schedule change?

If you have a one-off event that you need to show up in the Schedule and Widgets, you can create a Schedule Override by navigating to WordPress Dashboard > Radio Station > Schedule Overrides > Add New. This will allow you to set aside a block of time on a specific date, and when the Schedule or Widget is displaying that date, the override will be used instead of the normally scheduled Show. You can also link an Override to an existing Show, and partially update any Show information to be overridden. (Note that Schedule Overrides will not display in the old Legacy Table/Div Views of the Master Schedule.) In the Free version, if an Override needs to apply to multiple dates, you must schedule each time slot individually. In the PRO version, you can repeat the Override via day periods or monthly recurrences.

### Where is my data stored? Can I export my data?

Radio Station PRO is a WordPress plugin, which functions similarly to other WordPress themes and plugins by storing your site's settings and all post-type data in your WordPress MySQL database, which is connected to your website and accessed through your WordPress hosting account with the provider you chose. Similarly to all WordPress themes and plugins, when changing settings or adding content to a WordPress website, Radio Station (free and PRO) stores data in the MySQL database as it is added, edited, and published, updated, or saved. You can export your data using WordPress Dashboard > Tools > Export feature or Radio Station PROâ€™s Export feature located at WordPress Dashboard > Import/Export. Our import/export feature works with YML and not XML, which is the standard WordPress format.

### Can I import Show datae from Pro.Radio or the JOAN (Jock on Air Now) plugin?

We do not have a method of importing data directly from JOAN or Pro.Radio

### I'm seeing a 404 Not Found error when I click on the link for a Show! 

Try re-saving your site's permalink settings via Settings -> Permalinks. WordPress sometimes gets confused with a new custom post type is added. Permalink rewrites are automatically flushed on plugin activation, so you can also just deactivate and reactivate the plugin to regenerate your site's permalinks.

### What if I want to style how Radio Station's schedule displays on the frond end?

The default styles for Radio Station have intentionally kept fairly minimal so as to be compatible with most themes, so you may wish to add your own CSS styles to suit your site's look and feel. You can add these styles via Theme Customizer's Additional CSS setting. You can also add your own `rs-custom.css` file to your Child Theme's directory, and Radio Station will automatically detect the presence of this file and enqueue it. Either way you can add more specific selectors with rules that modify or override the existing styles. You can find the base styles in the `/css/` directory of the plugin. 

### What Widgets are available with this plugin?

The following Widgets are available to add via the WordPress Appearance -> Widgets page:
Current Show, Upcoming Shows, Current Playlist, Radio Clock and Streaming Player Widgets. See the [Widget Documentation](./Widgets.md) for more details on these Widgets.

### Do the Widgets reload automatically?

Current Show, Upcoming Shows and Current Playlist widgets do not refresh automatically in the Free version of Radio Station. This functionality is only available in our Pro version so widgets refresh exactly at a Show's changeover time. To enable s refresh exactly at Show changeover times. To enable auto-refresh widgets [upgrade to Radio Station PRO](https://radiostation.pro)

### What Shortcodes are available in Radio Station?

See the [Shortcode Documentation](./Shortcodes.md) for more details and a full list of possible Attributes for these Shortcodes:

* `[master-schedule]` - Master Program Schedule Display
* `[current-show]` - Current Show Widget
* `[upcoming-shows]` - Upcoming Shows Widget
* `[current-playlist]` - Current Playlist Widget
* `[shows-archive]` - Archive List of Shows
* `[genres-archive]` - Archive List of Shows sorted by Genre
* `[languages-archive]` - Archive List of Shows sorted by Language
* `[overrides-archive]` - Archive List of Schedule overrides
* `[playlists-archive]` - Archive List of Show Playlists

(Note old shortcode aliases will still work in current and future versions to prevent breakage.)

### How do I grant users other than Administrator and DJ roles permission to edit Shows and Playlists?

There are a number of different options depending on what your goals are.To address this situation, we have added a Show Editor role that can edit Shows without being an Administrator. This may help keep clear lines of separation for editorial responsibility over your content, as you may not want users with Autors or Conftirubyute roles to edit Shows, but to give a specific user the ability to do so. You can find more information on roles in the [Roles Documentation](./Roles.md)

### How do I change the Show Image displayed in the widgets and schedule? 

The widgets and schedule will display whichever avatar is assigned to the show on the Show Edit screen. Navigate in the WordPress Dashboard to Radio Station > Shows and locate the Show you want to add/edit the Avatar for in the Shows list. Simply set a new image for the Show.

### Why donâ€™t all WordPress Users appear in the Hosts or Producers lists on a Show Edit screen?

You need to assign the Host or Producer role to the users you want, so that you can select these users on the Show edit screen. You can assign roles by editing the User via the WordPress admin. The [Pro version](https://radiostation.pro) has an additional Role Editor interface where you can assign the plugin roles to any number of users at once.

### Why can't Show Hosts or Producers can't edit a Show page?

The only Hosts and Producers that may Edit a Show are the ones assigned as Host(s) or Producer(s) to that specific Show in the respective user selection menus. This is to prevent Hosts/Producers from editing other Shows managed by different Hosts/Producers without permission. 

### How do I use a different image from the Gravatar for a Host/Producer?

If you prefer not to use WordPress-owned, Gravatar.com for your User profile images, you'll need to install a plugin that allows lets you the ability to add a different image to your Host/Producer's Uuser account. You can search for a free plugin in the WordPress plugin repository at WordPress.org. As there are a number of plugins that do just this, it's a little out mostly out of the scope of this pluginâ€™s features. However, in our the Pro version,  you can create separate profile pages to showcase each of your Hosts and Producers, to which, you can and assign profile images that appear on those to these profile pages. If you would like to enable this feature, pelase upgrade here.


Then you'll need to install a plugin that lets you add a different image to your Host/Producer's user account. As there are a number of plugins that do just this, it's a little out of the scope of this plugin. However, in the [Pro version](https://radiostation.pro) you can create separate profile pages to showcase each of your Hosts and Producers, and assign profile images to these profile pages.

### What languages other than English is the plugin available in? 

Right now:

* Albanian (sq_AL)
* Dutch (nl_NL)
* French (fr_FR)
* German (de_DE)
* Italian (it_IT)
* Russian (ru_RU)
* Serbian (sr_RS)
* Spanish (es_ES)

### Can the plugin be translated into my language? 

You may translate the plugin into another language. Please visit our [WordPress Translate project page](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/radio-station/) for this plugin for further instruction. The `radio-station.pot` file is located in the `/languages` directory of the plugin. Please send the finished translation to `info@netmix.com`. We'd love to include it.

### Can I use this plugin for Podcasts?

While the plugin is not specifically geared toward Podcasting, which is not live programming, some podcaster's have used Radio Station to let their subscribers know when they publish new shows.

### Can I use this plugin for TwitchTV, Facebook Live, or Clubhouse shows?

Sure, there's no reason why you couldn't use the plugin to display a show schedule on a WordPress site for those services. Unfortunately, we are not currently syncing events from these platforms, but may do so in the future. While there may be APIs available from the larger services, Clubhouse does not yet have a public API, so scheduled rooms can't be automated to the Radio Station show scheduling system.

### I use Google Calendar to print a show schedule online. Can I import/sync my Google Calendar with Radio Station?

We haven't built an interface between Google Calendar and Radio Station just yet, but it's on our radar to do so in the foreseeable future.

### How do I install the latest Development version for testing?

If you are having issues with the plugin, we may recommend you install the development version for further bugfix testing, as it may contain fixes that are not yet released into the next stable WordPress version. It is recommended you do this on a staging site. Instructions:

1. Visit the `develop` branch of the Radio Station Github repository at:
`https://github.com/netmix/radio-station/tree/develop/`
2. Click on the green "Code" button and select Download a ZIP.
3. Unzip the downloaded file on your computer and upload it via FTP to the subdirectory of your WordPress install on your web server: `/wp-content/plugins/radio-station-develop/`
4. Rename the subdirectory `/wp-content/plugins/radio-station/` to `/wp-content/plugins/radio-station-old/`
5. Rename the subdirectory `/wp-content/plugins/radio-station-develop/` to `/wp-content/plugins/radio-station/`

Then upload to WordPress via the plugin installer as normal.
Note that it will install to /wp-content/plugins/radio-station-develop/, and because of this won't overwrite your existing installation, so you'll need to deactivate that before activating the development version.

You can now visit your site to make sure nothing is broken. If you experience issues you can reverse the folder renaming process to activate the old copy of the plugin. If the new development version works fine, at your convenience you can delete the `/wp-content/plugins/radio-station-old/` directory.

Alternatively, if you want to do this from your WordPress Plugin area, you can upload the development Zip file from your Plugins -> Upload page. This will install it to `/wp-content/plugins/radio-station-develop/`. You can then deactivate the existing Radio Station plugin from you Plugins page and then activate the development version. (You can tell them apart on the plugins page via their version numbers. Official releases are 2.x.x, only development releases have the extra digit 2.x.x.x) Again, if you experience issues, you can deactivate the development version and reactivate the old version.


### What about Pro Beta Version Testing?

We are constantly improving and adding new features to [Radio Station Pro](https://radiostation.pro/pricing/). Periodically we will release a Beta version to test out a new feature (or fix) out before it is officially released. If you have a Pro license, you can access these cutting edge Pro Beta version releases in two ways:

1. Download the Beta versions by logging in to your [Freemius User Dashboard](https://dashboard.freemius.com). and navigating to the "Downloads" section. You will see a dropdown list of all the Radio Station Pro releases, including beta ones.
2. Enable the Beta program option from your Radio Station Account page in your WordPress site's Admin area, and the latest Beta version will then be available as an update.

**Important Note**: As we are developing the Free and Pro versions in tandem, the latest Pro Beta may require you to install a development version of the Free plugin for it to work. Please see the previous section for how you can install the development version from Github if that version is not yet available via the WordPress repository.

We recommend you test these on a Staging site (or a development copy of your live site.) This way you can make sure there are no significant bugs before using it on a production site. Of course, please be willing to [report any bugs](https://github.com/netmix/radio-station/issues) that you do find so we can ensure they are not present in the next official release.
